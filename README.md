# Xamarin Ceramics Class
Projects used during my learnings around Xamarin

### Counter App
* Initial learnings were around how to add a label and use some of the settings to have it expand and/or fill the space of the mobile device.
* Some more concepts behind this project were to learn how to store state and change the state using an action.  It also took advantage of the Navigation page to traverse between the main page and the results page.


### ListView App
* Initial learnings were around how to initially display a `ListView` with just some static data.
* Need to be able to add an item to the `ListView`
* Need to be able to remove an item from the `ListView`
